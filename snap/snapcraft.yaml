summary: Arduino command-line interface
description: |
  Arduino CLI is an all-in-one solution that provides builder, boards/library manager,
  uploader, discovery and many other tools needed to use any Arduino compatible
  board and platforms.

  **Note**: this software is currently under active development: anything can change
  at any time, API and UI must be considered unstable until we release version 1.0.0.

  **Necessary plugs**
  If you are not able to list and/or upload to your board, you may need plugs and connects.
  See `snap connections arduino-cli` for necessary plugs (such as access to USB and serial ports) and connect them with 

  `$ sudo snap connect arduino-cli:<plug>`
  
  where `<plug>` can be in example `raw-usb`.
